# System to Measure The Distance using Ultrasonic Sensor

## Implementation
1. Use ATmega32 Microcontroller with frequency 8Mhz.
2. Measure the distance using the Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04. Check the â€œHC-SR04
   Ultrasonic.
3. The project should be design and implemented based on the layered architecture.
